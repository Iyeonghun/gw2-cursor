GW2-Cursor
==========

Small script to make the mouse cursor more visible in Guild Wars 2.

Look at the file `settings-example.ini` for some configuration options and examples for adding your own cursor.


Standalone Version
------------------

The `.exe` file is just the `.au3` source code file bundled with the cursor images and tray icon. You don't need AutoIt3 installed to run this version.
